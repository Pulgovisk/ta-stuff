Textadept stuff for you to play with

## [init.lua](init.lua)
This file contains my init.lua contents and should serve as an example for the multiedit module.
Please don't mind my other weird keybindings :>

### Parameters
There is one parameter to tune (`STAY_IN_LINE`) which will prevent the user from navigating beyond the end or before the start of the line containing the selection. True is the default as I prefer this behaviour.
