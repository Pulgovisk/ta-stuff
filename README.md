# ta-stuff
Textadept stuff for you to play with

## [init.lua](init.lua)

This file contains my init.lua contents and should serve as an example for the multiedit module.
Please don't mind my other weird keybindings :>

## [properties.lua](properties.lua)
This file is used by TextAdept when you open a new file. Contais some buffer settings.

### Parameters
There is one parameter to tune (`STAY_IN_LINE`) which will prevent the user from navigating beyond the end or before the start of the line containing the selection. True is the default as I prefer this behaviour.
